## Autotesting
This is a humble attemp, so don't take it seriously, because I had never ever had any experience with autotests.

#### Some description:
- Specs -- public constrains such as specs for request, usercredentials, greeting and such.
- LoginTokenProvides -- not actually the test, some util-class for providing tokens.
- AdminAccessTest -- created purely out of curiosity
- GetMethodsTests contains only /greeting
- UserProfilesTests contains checking the valid, invalid creating of user. I'm not sure if it's correct interpretation of 'scenario', but it seemed to me right to test all possibilities in one method.
